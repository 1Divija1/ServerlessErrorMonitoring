The AccessDeniedException can be corrected by assigning the roles and policies to the parent function that is calling the child function.
This error is resolved on the AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) GUI console. 
The first step is to define the policies. 
The next step is to bring the policies together in a common role.
And the third step is to enable the parent function with the newly created role so that it can call the child function successfully.
While assigning, both resouce and identity based policies for the child function must be included in the role.

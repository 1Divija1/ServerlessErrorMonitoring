The concurrent error can be corrected in either of the following ways:
1) Increase the reserved concurrency on the lambda GUI console.
Select the function --> Configuration --> Concurrency --> Increase reserved concurrency
2) Make sure that we are not invoking a function more than the reserved concurrency allowed. Making sure that previous instances of the function have terminated execution, are not in pending state etc.
